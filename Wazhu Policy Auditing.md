Wazuh is capable of auditing and monitoring an agent's configuration whilst proactively recording event logs. When the Wazuh agent is installed, an audit is performed where a metric is given using multiple frameworks and legislations such as NIST, MITRE and GDPR.

For example, see how this agent DC-01 scores against MITRE, NIST, and SCA:

These frameworks are outlined in the Pentesting Fundamentals room if you wish to learn more about them.

Wazuh presents a broad illustration of the logs. We can use the visualizations to break down this data and explore it further. Let's do this with the same agent. For example, see the benchmark for this domain controller running on a windows server:

Navigate to the "Modules" tab by pressing Wazuh -> Modules and open the "Policy Management" module like so:
