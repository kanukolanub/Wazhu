**Introduction**

**Endpoint detection and response (EDR)** are a series of tools and applications that monitor devices for an activity that could indicate a threat or security breach. 
These tools and applications have features that include:
Auditing a device for common vulnerabilities
Proactively monitoring a device for suspicious activity such as unauthorised logins, brute-force attacks or privilege escalations
Visualising complex data and events into neat and trendy graphs
Recording a device's normal operating behaviour to help with detecting anomalies

**Wazhu**
Wazhu is an open-source, freely available and extensive EDR solution. It can be used in all scales of environments. Wazuh operates on a management and agent module. Simply, a device is dedicated to running Wazuh named a manager, where Wazuh operates on a management and agent model where the manager is responsible for managing agents installed on the devices youâ€™d like to monitor.
